An implementation of a Hierarchical Attention Network for Document Classification from the following paper:

## Content
This repo contains the following:
- Implementation of the Network Architecture with the following technologies
    - Keras
    - Preprocessing with spaCy
    - Embedding Layer with pretrained Glove vectors
    - Tokenizing with Keras tokenizer
- Jupyter Notebook used during initial development of the network
- REST API server developed with FastAPI for predicting on a trained model and display of the sentence and word attentions in html 

## Train the model

## Start the server

### Make predictions

### Visualize prediction and attentions
